# RecapTime.dev base repository template

This template repository is designed to be a starting point for new projects at Recap Time Squad,
with a focus on batteries-included configuration such as GitHub issue contact links, labels-as-code
on GitHub, and issue templates/forms across both GitHub and GitLab, and a consistent structure for
community health files such as CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING and SECURITY.

## How to use this template

1. On GitHub, click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository.
  - Alternatively, you can clone this repository and push it to a new repository for GitLab and other code forges.
2. Replace the `README.md` contents with your project description, badges, and usage instructions.
3. Update the `LICENSE` file to match your project's license. Same with `LICENSE-DOCS` for documentation.
4. Review and update the `.github` and `.gitlab` directories for description templates (issue forms in GitHub), workflows/CI setup, and labels.
